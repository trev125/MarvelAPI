# Marvel API

A Marvel API app for Zach Fife to learn more HTML, CSS and Javacript

## How this will be structured:

This will be broken up into different weeks to complete the tasks, defined by the folder name. Each weeks work will be self contained in the weekly foler, meaning you won't need Week 1 stuff in Week 2.

If you need a refresher on Git, you can go [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/), if you want to see how this works in VSCode, [this is a good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2DBSH2VoHQ) for that (you don't need to follow a long with the video, but it shows how to use the built in Version Control in VS Code)
