# Marvel API

A Marvel API app for Zach Fife to learn more HTML, CSS and Javacript

## How this will be structured:

This will be broken up into different weeks to complete the tasks, defined by the branch (ie, week-1 will be week 1's work, week-2 will be week 2's work, etc.). Each week you will checkout the branch for the week

If you need a refresher on Git, you can go [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/), if you want to see how this works in VSCode, [this is a good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2DBSH2VoHQ) for that (you don't need to follow a long with the video, but it shows how to use the built in Version Control in VS Code)
